            <p class="text">A calorie is equal to the amount of energy required to raise one liter of water one dregree Celsius.<code>100 calories can raise the temperature of 100-liter jug by one degree C</code> These units of energy provide the physiological currency for everything, from movement to pumping blood to digesting our food. Without them none of us would be alive.
Most people dont think of calories as energy units but as something related to gaining weight. Calories arent bad but their inneficient use does make us hold onto body fat.
In sports performance calories are importat because they fuel your training and competitive energy needs, eating few calories will impact negatively your training and performance, will also make you lose muscle mass, muscle strenght and metabolism. Your mass to strenght to power ratios will be suboptimal. 
Having this in consideration, is crucial to understand that calorie intake alone its not the only thing important, but calorie expenditure as well. The balance between energy intake and energy output is critical.</p>

            <header id="subtitle2">Macronutrients</header>
            <h2 id="subtitle">Protein</h2>
            <p class="text"> Amino acids are the building blocks of protein, as they join together to form petides, which, in turn, join together to form protein.
There are 20 amino acids, 9 of which are essential or indispensable, meaning they ar enecessary in the diet. The body cant make them so we've got to eat them or we'll suffer from malnutrition. Because of the eseentiality of these aminoacids, it's important that we eat a certain amount of protein each day to prevent malnutrition. This amount has been established at <code> 0.8g x kg of body mass </code> In case of an athlete the RDA (recommended dietary allowance) is up to <code> 2.0g protein x kg body mass </code>.
In sports nutrition, rather than focusing on the prevention of a protein deficiency, the athlete must emphasize on optimize health, body composition and performance with an increased protein intake, this increase has multiple benefits which may include:
<ul>
    <li>1. Increased Thermic Effect of Feeding.</li>
    <p>While all macronutrients require metabolic processing for digestion,
absorption, and storage or oxidation, the thermic effect (metabolic effect) of
protein is roughly double that of carbohydrates and fat. Therefore, eating a
higher protein intake (relative to the RDA) may actually promote fat burning
and a higher metabolism. Just be sure to get that protein every 2-3 hours.</p>
    <li>2. Increased Glucagon.</li>
    <p>Protein consumption increases blood concentrations of a hormone called
glucagon. Glucagon is responsible for greater fat movement out of fat cells.
Also, glucagon decreases the amounts and activities of the enzymes
responsible for making and storing fat in adipose and liver cells. As a result,
increased protein intakes may decrease daily fat balance, leading to fat loss
and an increased muscle: fat ratio</p>
    <li>3. Increased IGF-1.</li>
    <p>Protein and amino-acid supplementation has been shown to increase the IGF1 response to both exercise and feeding. IGF-1 is a hormone related to
muscle growth. Therefore another advantage associated with consuming
more protein may be more muscle growth when overfeeding and/or muscle
sparing when trying to lose fat. </p>
    <li>4. Reduction in cardiovascular risk.</li>
    <p>Several studies have shown that increasing the percentage of protein in the
diet (from 11% to 23%) while decreasing the percentage of carbohydrate
(from 63% to 48%) lowers “bad cholesterol” and triglyceride concentrations in
the blood while increasing “good cholesterol” in the blood. </p>
    <li>5. Improved Weiht-Loss Profile.</li>
    <p>Researchers have demonstrated that reducing the carbohydrate ratio from
3.5:1 to 1.4:1 increases body fat loss, spares muscle mass, reduces triglyceride
concentrations, improves satiety, and improves blood glucose management
during fat loss diets.</p>
    <li>6. Increased Protein Turnover</li>
    <p>As discussed in the introduction, all tissues of the body, including muscle, go
through a regular program of turnover. Since the balance between protein
breakdown and protein synthesis (building) governs muscle protein turnover,
increased protein turnover may best improve muscle adaptations to training.
By increasing protein synthesis (building) and protein breakdown, a diet high
in both protein and energy intake may help break down muscle more rapidly.
While this might not sound good at first glance, think about it this way. If
you’re breaking down muscle faster, training hard, and eating properly, you’ll
actually build that broken down muscle back up faster. This means that your
76
body will become better adapted to your training and this will happen much
more quickly.</p>
    <li>7. Increased provision of auxuliary nutrients</li>
    <p>Although the benefits mentioned above have related specifically to protein
and amino acids, it's important to recognize that we don't just eat protein and
amino acids — we eat food. Therefore, higher protein diets often provide
other nutrients that could enhance performance and/or muscle growth. These
nutrients include creatine, branched chain amino acids, conjugated linoleic
acids, and/or additional nutrients that are important, yet remain to be
discovered. </p>
    <li>8. Increased Satiety</li>
    <p>Protein foods are more filling than other foods. When someone increases their
protein intake, they tend to reduce their chances of overeating on other
foods. This considerably helps out with body weight management</p> 
</ul>              
            <h3 id="subtitle">Carbohidrates</h3>
           
            <p>Even tho high carbohydrate diets are recommended, many experts have challenged this, with researches that demonstrates that this type of diets can lead to serious health problems and difficult time with fat loss. However low carb diet will impact an athlete with impaired exercise performance, a reduction in work capacity, supressed inmune fucntion and increase in perception of effort during normal exercise tasks. 
If as an athlete your main dietary focus are cabrohydrates, you're likely to ignore the dietary proteins and fats essential for optimal health, body composition and performance. Therefore it's more important to emphasize carbohydrate type and type rather than ammount.
The athlete should replace their high glycemic index, micronutrient devoid carbohydrate source(candy, breakfast cereals. sodas, juices, breads, pastas), with a lower glycemic micronutrient rich carbohydrate choices(beans, ancient grains, unprocessed breads, pastas, fruits, vegetables) which are digested slowly and provide continous energy throghout the day. By doing this the athlete will be able to manage dailty energy fluctuations, lose fat while preserving muscle mass and prevent micronutrient deficiencies.
            <h4 id="subtitle">fats</h4>
            <p> Dietary fat is essential to the athlete diet, restricting it leads to negative health, body composition and performance consequences.
                There are 3 main types of dietary fatty acids:
                <ol>
                    <li>Saturated fatty acids.</li>
                    <li>Monounsaturated fatty acids.</li>
                    <li>Polyunsaturated fatty acids</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
 In the past it was believed that fat made you fat. However this is not the case, some fats can improve body composition by promoting fat loss, also improve training homronal status, increase the body's ability to store glyocgen, increase the body's ability to burn fat, and improve overall health by providing anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-oxidant effects. 
 Athletes should ingest approximately 30% of their diets as fat, as long as the invidiual proportions of fatty acids are disributed appropriately.  </p>

            <h1 id="subtitle">Calories calculator</h1>
            <p>The Calorie Calculator can be used to estimate the number of calories a person needs to consume each day. This calculator can also provide some simple guidelines for gaining or losing weight. You can calculate your calorie intake using diverse formulas, the most used formula along sport nutritionists is the Mifflin St. Jeor formula. Which calculates your basal metabolic rate, and its results are based on an estimated average.
                <code>Men - 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) + 5
Women - 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) – 161</code>

            <h2 id="subtitle">Macros calculator</h2>
            <p>In recent years, a dietary approach called IIFYM, or "if it fits your macros," has taken the fitness world by storm. Also known as "flexible dieting," it turns old-school, calorie-based dieting on its head by focusing instead on the amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fats making up those calories. As long as you come close to your numbers (how close remains a subject of debate), you have a lot of flexibility on what foods you can use to get there.

                <li>Establish your daily caloric intake <code>ie: 2000cal</code></li>
            <li>Establish your macronutrient percenteages based on your goal<code>4 0% protein, 35% carbohydrate, 35% fats</code></li>
                <li> Calculate daily calories per macronutrient intake <code>ie: 800cal/4 = 200gr protein, 700cal/4 = 175 gr carb, 700cal/10 = 70gr fat</code> </li>
                <li>Start by adding your protein sources by weight, until you reach the total ammount of grams you should eat per day <code>ie: 4 eggs = 28gr prot, 200gr chicken breast = 60gr prot, 200gr ground beef = 50gr prot, 1 can of tuna = 43gr prot, 100gr beef liver= 20gr prot. Total ammount of protein= 201grams.</code></li>
                <li>Do the same process now with your carbohydrates and then with your fats until you reach the total ammount of grams and calories per macronutrient</li>
                <li>Do 3 or 4 variations of this with different foods and macro values depending of the activity level, to add variety to your diet</li>
